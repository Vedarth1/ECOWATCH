vercel
```

Alternatively, you can build the project and deploy it to any static hosting service:

```
npm run build
```

Then deploy the `out` directory to your hosting service.

## Performance Optimization

This application is optimized for performance:

- Server-side rendering for faster initial load
- Code splitting and lazy loading of components
- Optimized images and assets
- Efficient state management
- Memoization of expensive computations
